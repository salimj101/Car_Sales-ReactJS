## Car Sales ReactJS

This project is a modern car sales web application built with ReactJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It allows users to browse a selection of cars, add them to a cart, and view their selected cars in a stylish sidebar. The UI is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, with features such as:

- Home page with hero section and navigation bar
- Car listing with quantity controls and add-to-cart functionality
- Cart sidebar that slides in from the side, showing selected cars and allowing removal
- About, Services, Brands, Testimonials, and Footer sections
- Beautiful styling using Tailwind CSS
